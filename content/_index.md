description: I am a Professor of the Practice and the Director of Undergraduate 
  Studies at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) and 
  an affiliated faculty in the [Computational Media, Arts, and Cultures](https://cmac.duke.edu/) 
  program at Duke University. My work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science 
  pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered 
  learning, and open-source education. I work on integrating computation into the 
  undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies 
  and analysis of real and complex datasets. In addition to my academic work, 
  I also work as a Data Scientist and Professional Educator at 
  [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/), where I focus primarily on education for 
  open-source R packages as well as building resources and tools for educators 
  teaching statistics and data science with R and RStudio.
