description: I am a Professor of the Practice and the Director of Undergraduate 
  Studies at the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) and 
  an affiliated faculty in the [Computational Media, Arts, and Cultures](https://cmac.duke.edu/) 
  program at Duke University. My work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science 
  pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered 
  learning, and open-source education. I work on integrating computation into the 
  undergraduate statistics curriculum, using reproducible research methodologies 
  and analysis of real and complex datasets. In Spring 2024, I'm teaching 
  [STA 199 - Introduction to Data Science and Statistical Thinking](https://sta199-s24.github.io/) and  
  [STA 313 - Advanced Data Visualization](https://vizdata.org).
