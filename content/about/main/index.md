  ### Statistical Science at Duke
  
  You can find out everything you need to know about majoring in Statistical Science at Duke [here](https://stat.duke.edu/undergraduate). If you would like to meet to discuss degree options in the department, you can book a time to meet with me [here](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/mc301@duke.edu/pbp/) or send an email to [stat-dus@duke.edu](mailto:stat-dus@duke.edu).
  
  ### Statistics and data science education
  
  I primarily work on developing open-educational resources and software for modern statistics and data science education as well as pedagogies for enhancing the student experience in data science and statistics courses. I also work on research projects that aim to assess the effectiveness of these approaches with respect to learning and retention. My computing language of choice is R, though I'm always interested in learning about how educators teaching different languages approach the same challenges.

  ### Open-access education
  
  I am also very active in open access education. I have co-authored four open-source statistics textbooks as part of the OpenIntro project at the introductory college and advanced high school level. I am also the creator and maintainer of [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/) and I have been developing and teaching various massive open online courses, including the popular [Statistics with R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics) specialization on Coursera.
  
  ### ASA DataFest
  
  I co-lead the international effort for putting on ASA DataFest, a two-day competition in which teams of undergraduate students work to reveal insights into a rich and complex data set, annually at over fifty institutions across the globe.

  ### Applied statistics research
  
  My applied statistics research is mostly driven by interdisciplinary collaborations that arise from statistical consulting. I am particularly interested in collaborating on research projects that focus on data visualization.
