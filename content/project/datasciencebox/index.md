excerpt: How can we effectively and efficiently teach data science to students with little to no background in computing and statistical thinking? How can we equip them with the skills and tools for reasoning with various types of data and leave them wanting to learn more? This introductory data science course is our (working) answer to this question.

### <img src = "featured.png" width="100" align = "left"> [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org/) is a repository for open-source course materials for a semester-long, college-level, introductory data science course that teaches R.

---

Data Science in a Box contains the materials required to teach (or learn from) a semester-long, college-level, introductory data science course that teaches R, all of which are [freely-available and open-source](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/master/LICENSE.md). The materials include course slide decks, lecture and live coding videos, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as resources for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics.

The project also features an accompanying R package, [**dsbox**](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/), which contains datasets used in the course as well as interactive tutorials built with [**learnr**](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/).
