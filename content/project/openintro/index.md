The OpenIntro project was founded in 2010 with a mission to make educational products that are free, transparent, and lower barriers to education.

As part of this project I have co-authored four textbooks:

- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/), with Johanna Hardin
- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/}), with David Diez and Chris Barr
- [Advanced High School Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/ahss/), with David Diez, Leah Dorazio, and Chris Barr
- [Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/book/isrs/), with David Diez and Chris Barr

I also develop and maintain supplementary materials, including 
- A set of R packages that contain datasets used in our resources: 
  - [**openintro**](https://openintrostat.github.io/openintro)
  - [**cherryblossom**](https://openintrostat.github.io/cherryblossom)
  - [**airports**](https://openintrostat.github.io/airports)
  - [**usdata**](https://openintrostat.github.io/usdata)
- [Interactive tutorials](https://openintrostat.github.io/ims-tutorials/)
- [Computing labs](https://openintrostat.github.io/oilabs-tidy/)
- Lecture slides, videos, sample exams, and more...
