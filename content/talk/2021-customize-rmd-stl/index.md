For data analysis output to be reproducible, the data and code should be assembled in a way such that results (e.g. tables and figures) can be re-created. In this workshop we will demonstrate a workflow for reproducible data science with R, R Markdown and discuss how R Markdown documents of various flavours and output types can be customized to achieve a customized look and style. In addition to customization, we will also touch on using RStudio’s visual editor for authoring in R Markdown.
