In this webinar, we will introduce a data-centric and simulation-based curriculum for introductory statistics. We will discuss the motivation and goals of the curriculum as well as give a few examples of datasets and classroom activities. We will also introduce an open-source and free textbook (Introduction to Modern Statistics) and supplementary interactive tutorials and computing labs for teaching this curriculum.
