This session is programmed in support of the AI for Art 2022 Competition. Faculty and staff from the Visual Arts and Statistical Science will explore the role of computational processes in the making of visual art. How do the methods of art creation intersect with the resulting work? Is a system capable of massive iterative outcomes capable of art making? Where do the tolerances, affordances and bounds of technologies become opportunities for visual art? Examples of artwork, data visualization and generative processes will be discussed with examples from contemporary and historic practitioners.
