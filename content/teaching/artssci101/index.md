The field of public health seeks to promote the healthiest lives possible of people and
communities. In this class, we will discuss, analyze, and write about complex issues in public
health, including smoking, breast cancer screening, physical activity, vaccination, and health
disparities through the lens of statistical and scientific reasoning. We will use the scientific
literature as a basis for discussion of these issues and to illustrate academic writing and
statistical concepts. Furthermore, through course writing and statistics assignments, we will
consider multiple hypotheses about the causes and prevention of health problems and show
that the path between data and inference is not as clear­cut as it often appears to be in the
popular media by critically examining the scientific research literature. As a students, you and
your peers will lead class discussions and collaborate with peers on the major projects of the
course, which will integrate statistical analysis and academic writing.
